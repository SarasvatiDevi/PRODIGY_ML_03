**Cat vs Dog Classifier using SVM**

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset. The images are processed using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features for robust image classification.

**Dataset**

Download the dataset from Kaggle:

**Features**

Uses HOG features for image representation.

Implements Linear SVM for classification.

Supports model saving with joblib.

Lightweight and works on small datasets too (customizable via limit parameter).

**Technologies Used**

Python

OpenCV

scikit-learn

scikit-image

NumPy

joblib
